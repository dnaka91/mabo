Data format and schema, with a type system as strong as Rust's.

This project is currently still in a _pre-alpha_ stage and undergoing many changes until the first alpha release. Nonetheless, it should already be usable from the Rust side but expect breaking changes often.

For further details about how to get started, the schema language or anything else, please consult the official [project website](https://dnaka91.github.io/mabo/).
