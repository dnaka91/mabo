# Documentation

The `doc` generator does not generate source code, but instead documentation for a Mabo project. It interprets comments as [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and renders static pages for each element.

This generator is not available as a standalone binary but instead available through the Mabo command line interface with the [mabo doc](../cli/doc) command.

## Hosting

The documentation output consists of static files that can be hosted by any static file host. A common and easy way is to use **GitHub Pages**.
