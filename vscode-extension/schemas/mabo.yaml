      List of files that make up the schema package. These are not regular file paths but glob patterns, meaning that
      file trees can be defined in a consise way like `schemas/**/*.mabo`.

      Regardless of the [glob pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) defined the final file list is
      always filtered by the `.mabo` file extension.
